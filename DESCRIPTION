Title: Build Decision Trees with Optimal Multivariate Splits
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Yanchao Liu
Maintainer: Yanchao Liu <yanchaoliu@wayne.edu>
Description: Functions for training an optimal decision tree classifier, making predictions and generating latex code for plotting. Works for two-class and multi-class classification problems. The algorithm seeks the optimal Boolean rule consisting of multiple variables to split a node, resulting in shorter trees. Use bsnsing() to build a tree, predict() to make predictions and plot() to plot the tree into latex and PDF. See Yanchao Liu (2022) <arXiv:2205.15263> for technical details.
